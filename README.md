Welcome to my portfolio!

This collection represents a variety of projects I have completed as personal work as well as school work. Each project has its own explanation for my implementation and for the dependencies required to run the project. This portfolio displays a variety of skills I have learned throughout my programming career, including developing a physics simulation from scratch, implementing a ray tracer for modeling light in 3D space, using React Native and Expo to develop and simulate IOS/android applications, directly allocating memory through system function calls, and predicting house sale prices through a variety of machine learning models including decision forests, regression, and neural networks.
