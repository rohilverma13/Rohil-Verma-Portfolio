This is my favorite project that I've completed. In this project, you can see how I implemented ray tracing so that when a mouse
cursor is hovering over a bone of the skeleton, a cylinder around the bone lights up. Once a bone is highlighted, you can rotate 
that bone. Press different numbers (1-7) to see different skeletons and different meshes that have been placed on top of the skeleton.

Here are the steps to run this project: 

1. Get NPM package installer
2. Install typescript compiler, off screen canvas, and http-server:
      npm install -g typescript
      npm install -g http-server
      npm install --save @types/offscreencanvas
3. Run the make-skinning.py file
4. Launch http server:
      http-server dist -c-1

Enjoy!
